# Litheora
A modern, lightweight and easy to use Content Management System (CMS) written in Python.

# Philosophy (In order of importance)
- Freedom: Users should have control over their software, which is why we use a free (as in freedom) license.
- Modularity: The application is broken up into many modules, so components can be easily replaced.
- Simplicity: The application should be easy to use, and easy to understand.
- Flexibility: The application should be able to be used in many different ways.
- Lightweight: The application should be fast, and not use too many resources.

# Planned Features
- Block Editor: A block editor is used to edit pages, we even allow users to edit the block types themselves.
- Pages: Pages are the main content of the website, they are made up of blocks, a page can be based on another page. we call these template pages.
- Users: With the "Security" plugin, users can be created, and given permissions to edit pages. Otherwise any user can edit any page.
- Plugins: Our modular design allows for plugins to be easily added, and removed. Plugins can add new block types, or even new themeing for the site.
