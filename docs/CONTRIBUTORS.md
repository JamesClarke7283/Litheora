## Documentation
We have a docs directory.  Feel free to submit pull requests to add to the documentation.

## Testing
Feel free to do Exploratory Testing and submit issues for bugs you find.
Also Automated Testing using Selenium is welcome.

## Code
At this time, the amount of code we are accepting is limited, due to being in the planning stage.
But feel free to submit pull requests for code that you think would be useful.

## Design
We are always looking for wireframes, mockups, and other design ideas.
As this is a modular solution we can even encorporate multiple design patterns if neccessary.
Just make sure to export your design as a plain SVG file, so we can easily import it into our design software.

Look at the [Design Document](DESIGN.md) for inspiration on design.
