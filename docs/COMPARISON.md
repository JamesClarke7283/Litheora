# Comparison
Drupal is a powerful, developer-focused CMS that offers extensive functionality and customizability. It's ideal for building complex, large-scale websites but can be overkill for simpler projects. Drupal's steep learning curve can be a barrier to entry for non-technical users.

WordPress is the most popular CMS worldwide, known for its ease of use and a massive library of themes and plugins. It's excellent for blogs and small to medium-sized websites. However, it can struggle with performance issues for larger, more complex sites, and its popularity makes it a common target for hackers.

Joomla falls somewhere between WordPress and Drupal in terms of complexity. It's more robust than WordPress but easier to use than Drupal. Joomla has strong social networking and e-commerce features but lacks the extensive plugin and theme library that WordPress offers.

Plone is a secure, flexible CMS built on Python. It's known for its strong security, making it a popular choice for government and university sites. However, Plone's complexity and the relative scarcity of themes and add-ons can make it challenging for beginners.

Now let's talk about NimbleCMS:

- Ease of Use: NimbleCMS offers an intuitive interface that's easy for beginners to grasp, similar to WordPress, but also provides the power and flexibility that advanced users appreciate in systems like Drupal and Plone.

- Performance: NimbleCMS is built to be lightweight and fast. It manages to offer robust features without the bloat that can slow down WordPress and Joomla.

- Customizability: Like Drupal and Joomla, NimbleCMS has a flexible block and page type system, allowing for a high degree of customization. Plus, the Jinja templates provide further control over design, surpassing the customizability available in WordPress or Joomla.

- Security: NimbleCMS follows the security-first approach of Plone, ensuring your content is safe and secure.

- Plugin System: NimbleCMS has an innovative plugin system that offers the extensive plugin availability similar to WordPress while also providing a powerful Plugin API for developers, similar to Drupal's module system.

- Asset Management: NimbleCMS goes beyond the traditional CMS by offering built-in asset storage and automatic image optimization, features typically requiring additional plugins in WordPress, Joomla, or Drupal.

By combining the best features of these popular CMS platforms into one sleek, efficient package, NimbleCMS presents a powerful new option for content management. Whether you're a beginner building your first site or an advanced developer needing a robust, flexible platform, NimbleCMS is a compelling choice.
