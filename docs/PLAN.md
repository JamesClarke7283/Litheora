# Nimble CMS Plan

## Leo's ideas
- Easy creation of fast and lightweight websites  
- Web interface for admin  
- Use Redis for caching (cache the rendered pages)  
- Store content in database (not the actual rendered HTML pages though)  
- Plugin Support  
     - Loaded by placing plugin in a plugin folder  
     - Plugin API for allowing plugins easy access to certain features (as   
well as low level stuff)  
- Add admin features  
    - Page analytics  
    - Add pre-built blocks / page types  
- Built in asset storage  
- Convert images uploading into web friendly format  
- Websites built with blocks / page types  
- Build your own blocks with go template
